\section{CONCLUSION}

\paragraph{}
After finish this project, I have some new experiences. Each condition added must be logic, and must consider the relation between it and others. The invariant's placement is important also, since one theorem cannot use the one that is defined after it. And math logic is very important also. Sometimes it's better to re-define even the definition of some characteristic, so you can always re-use it, better than have to re-proving each time it comes in need.
