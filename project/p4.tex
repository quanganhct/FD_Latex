\section{Check if the values of one array is included in another one}

\begin{itemize}
\item Specification: ValueIncludedMachine
\item Implementation:
\begin{itemize}
	\item ValueIncludedMachineImplementation
	\item ValueIncludedMachineImplementation2
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{}
\textbf{ValueIncludedMachineImplementation} is a machine that check the values of the two arrays whether they satisfy :
$$
\forall{i}\cdot i \in dom(array1) \Rightarrow (\exists j \cdot j \in dom(array2) \Rightarrow array1(i) = array2(j))
$$

The complexity of this problem is:
$$
O(n_{1}, n_{2}) = n_{1}. n_{2} \quad  n_{1}=card(dom(array1)) \land n_{2}=card(dom(array2))
$$
\paragraph{}
\textbf{ValueIncludedMachineImplementation2} is a special case of \textbf{ValueIncludedMachineImplementation}, where the two given arrays are sorted in ascending order.

\paragraph{}
The POs that need to be proved interactively are:
\begin{itemize}
\item liveness/WD (in both of the implementations)
\item liveness/THM (in both of the implementations)
\end{itemize}

The tactic that was used to prove, is \textbf{Disjunction to implication}
