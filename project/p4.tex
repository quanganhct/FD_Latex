\section{Check if the values of one array is included in another one}

\begin{itemize}
\item Specification: ValueIncludedMachine
\item Implementation:
\begin{itemize}
	\item ValueIncludedMachineImplementation
	\item ValueIncludedMachineImplementation2
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{}
\textbf{ValueIncludedMachineImplementation2} is a special case of \textbf{ValueIncludedMachineImplementation}, where the two given arrays are sorted in ascending order.

\paragraph{}
The POs that need to be proved interactively are:
\begin{itemize}
\item liveness/WD (in both of the implementations)
\item liveness/THM (in both of the implementations)
\end{itemize}

The tactic that was used to prove, is \textbf{Disjunction to implication}
