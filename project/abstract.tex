Formal Methods in System Design allows the designing, implementing, and validating the correctness of the system. In this project, I will implement and prove the correctness of the machines that check a given array if it's sorted in ascending order, sorted (ascending or descending), check two given arrays if they are identicals, if one array included the other, and sort a given array in ascending order
