Formal Methods in System Design allows the designing, implementing, and validating the correctness of the system. In this project, I implemented and proved the correctness of the machines that check a given array if it's sorted in ascending order, sorted (ascending or descending), check two given arrays if they are identicals, if one array included the other, and sort a given array in ascending order

The purpose of this paper, is to deliver the process of proving the proof obligations, those that was proved interactively, as well as the reasoning for the unproved ones.
