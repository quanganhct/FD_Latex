\section{INTRODUCTION}

In the last lesson of Formal Design, we were given a project to finish. Our job is to design several machines that :

\begin{itemize}
\item check if a given array is sorted in ascending order
\item check if a given array is sorted (ascending or descending order)
\item check if two given arrays are identical
\item given two arrays, check if one array included the other one
\item given an array with pairwise distinct values, sort this array in ascending order
\item given an array, sort this array in ascending order
\end{itemize}

I used a software, named \textbf{Rodin}, to do this project. Some theories will be proved in this paper, if cannot be proved in the program.
